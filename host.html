		<p>
			In Mohnish's book, the Dhandho Investor, he talks about his investment philosophy at length. Among the most important points:
			<ol>
				<li>Look for "no brainers"- or 0 risk with unlimited reward (Dhandho)</li>
				<li>Focus on "arbitrage" opportunities, especially in entrepreneurship</li>
				<li>Bet heavily when odds are in your favor</li>
				<li>Heads I win tails I don't lose much mentality</li>
				<li>Look towards opportunities under distress and uncertainty</li>
			</ol>
		As an immigrant to America, Mohnish uses many immigrants as examples on how to do investing and entrepreneurship in a low-risk high-reward manner.
