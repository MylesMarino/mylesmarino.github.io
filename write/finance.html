		<p>I am not a professional wealth advisor. Do not treat me as such.</p>
		<p>This is my playbook for creating wealth, made public. Treat it as such.</p>
		<p><strong>Ask me questions!</strong> I have blind spots. Help me fix them. Ask a question.</p>

	<h2 id = "free">Free</h2>
		<i><q>Thereâ€™s only one success: to be able to live your life your way</q></i> - Christopher Morley
		<p><strong>Be Independent of Money.</strong> Seriously. Dependence begets misery. You cannot be truly free if you are truly dependent. Do not believe convention, as the convention is dependence. Do not abdicate your autonomy over your life and financial situation. Stop making execuses and start being independent. Make money your servent, not your master.</p>
		<p><strong>Avoid Consumption.</strong> It is all empty. Futile. It means nothing. If you must consume, deeply consume experiences. Make memories, not materials. Buy only what you need, and buy it well. Consume for others, not yourself. Realize everything else is not worth it. You probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory">do not actually want to consume</a>. Make money to be independent, not to consume.</p>
	<h2 id = "save">Save</h2>
		<p><strong>Spend less than you earn.</strong> And then save it. Make a lot of money by being useful to others. <a href="https://sive.rs/gethired">Especially your heros</a>. Then do not spend it all. This is not normal. Be intentinoal</p>
		<p><strong>Track your numbers.</strong> Make sure this does not become an obsession. But seriously, track your numbers. Find what you can cut. Find what has worked when you saved. Figure it out. See your progress over time. But- do not obsess over this. Obsession is dangerous. Just know what works for you and what does not.</p>
	<h2 id = "compound">Compound</h2>
		<p><strong>Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world.</strong> Einstein said that. You either earn it, or you pay it. Understand compound interest. Use a calculator. See the difference between compound and simple interest? Which do you want to earn, and which do you want to pay? Note that many things compound. Relationships, knowledge, etc. Compound.</p>
		<p><strong>To compound:</strong> first maximize time, then return, then contributions. Make modest sums large.</p>
		<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> hitting '0', unecessary interruptions, and things that do not compound. 0 does not compound. Neither does stalling. If it does not compound- why do you want it?</p>
	<h2 id = "leverage">Leverage</h2>
		<p><strong>Create situations where output > input.</strong> This is called leverage. If your input = output, you are doing something wrong. Do something once. Have it pay you 1000 times. Even while you sleep. Create situations where you can get outsized returns considering your input.</p>
		<p><strong>You can leverage money, time, knowlede, and more.</strong> You will be suprised what you can leverage. It is everywhere. This does not just apply to money. Find quicker ways to do things. Leverage other people's experiences and learn from them. Leverage everything.</p>
		<p><strong>Always look for ways to apply leverage.</strong> Like I said- leverage is everywhere. But you have to find it. Think about what is in this room. What can you leverage? Think about the last task you did. You already used a little leverage. How can you apply more?</p>
	<h2 id = "ownership">Ownership</h2>
		<p><strong>Name of the game: OWN LARGE EQUITY STAKES IN VALUABLE ASSETS.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Find things that compound and have leverage (for example: businesses).</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Businesses can <strong>reinvest</strong> earnings and grow. Build a store. Make money. Build another store. Make more money. Repeat.</li>
			<li>Because they are repeatable, businesses are <strong>valued by a multiple of earnings</strong>. IE a business earning $1 may be worth 10x that, or $10. Increase earnings by $1, and get $10 tax free. Compare an employee that generates $1M for their employer. The employee keeps $500K. The employer keeps $5M. See the leverage?</li>
			<li>Businesses <strong>operate without you</strong>. Go to sleep. Enjoy life. If you buy Apple stock and go to sleep- people are still going to buy iPhones. Berkshire Hathaway owns over 80 businesses. How many does Warren Buffett run? 0.</li>
			<li>Use <strong>passive indexes</strong>. These allow you to own 100+ businesses. You automatically get the average result of the market. Less hassle. Less expenses. Better returns. This takes less than 1 hour per year. Have a plan, and stick with it.</li>
		</ul>
	<h2 id = "internalzie">Internalize</h2>
		<p><strong>Figure out what works. Then use it.</strong> But nobody is going to figure it all out for you. do it yourself. Then go. You will make mistakes. Do not wait. But focus on what works for yourself. Not for others. For you.</p>
		<p><strong>Build conviction with common sense, excel, and a plan.</strong> You barely believed anything I wrote above. Good. Do not believe what anybody says. Instead, build conviction by yourself. Use common sense. Does what this person says make sense? Use excel. Does compounding really make a difference? Have a plan. Not mine. Not anybody elses. Make it your plan.</p>
		<p><strong>Be rational, take your time, keep learning.</strong> It is harder than it sounds. But do not be discouraged. You got this!</p>
