	<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
		<p>My goal is to take you from 0 to website creation</p>
		<p>This is meant to show you <strong>practical</strong> basics- nothing more</p>
		<p>I use windows. There are some commands which may be different on a mac. Oops. If you are stuck- try <a href="https://google.com">Googling your problem</a>
		<p>A few points before we dive in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>have confidence </strong> in yourself. you are smart enough. all you need to learn in a few things and then consitently apply them. you can do it</li>
			<li><strong>learning is need based </strong> so have a problem you want to solve. do not code just to code. solve a small, tiny, simple, problem</li>
			<li><strong>google stuff </strong> all the time. because 1) somebody has ran into your problem before and 2) you cannot know everything. even the best developers google!</li>
			<li><strong>computers are stupid </strong> but you are not. be precise. a computer will only <a href="https://youtu.be/j-6N3bLgYyQ">do what you tell it</a></li>
			<li><strong>you can be faster </strong> at programming if you try. for everything that you do- there is always a quicker way. keep that in mind!
			<li><strong>code along </strong> instead of using notes. it is tempting to write everything down- but your fingers have brains. code along and get used to writing in code instead of writing in pencil</li>
		</ul>

	<h4 id="terminal">Termianl</h4>
		<p>Every computer has a terminal. Search for the application- and see what comes up</p>
		<p>Terminals are used to communicate with your computer via text, This is opposed to clicking around and using your mouse</p>
		<p>Why use the terminal? For one it is versitile. Two, it is percise. Three, it is quicker.</p>
		<p>As an example: consider driving somehwere vs Uber. Uber may be sexier- as you can use a sleek app from your phone. But driving your car is more versitile (Uber does not drive some places), more percise (Uber does not know exactly where you want to go) and faster (you have to wait for Uber)</p>
		<p>Terminals are the weapon of choice for developers. There are not many commands you need to know, and it is easy to understand after a while<p>
		<p>Note that a lot of these commands can be combined. Try them out!</p>

		<h5>Navigating the Terminal (for mac)</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Tab | auto complete. if you have a file named myles.txt, type myl<tab> and the terminal will populate myles.txt</li>
			<li>Ctrl + L | Clear screen. things get cluttered!</li>
			<li>Shift + Cmd + V | paste plain text</li>
			<li>Option + Shift + Cmd + C | Copy plain text</li>
			<li>exit | exit terminal</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Navigating Files</h5>
		<ul>
			<li> ls | lists files in the current directory. directory means folder. this will show your files, directories and more. Try it now</li>
			<li>cd "directory" | change directory. this allows you to go in or out of directories. cd .. brings you back a directory. cd ~ bring you to the root directory (where your terminal starts. list your directories and cd into one. now cd back out</li> 
			<li>mkdir "new_directory" | creates a new directory. cd into downloads and create a new directory called "my_files"</li>
			<li>touch "file_name"| creates a file. cd into your "downloads" directory and create a file named "abi.txt"</li>
			<li>mv "file' "new_file" | move or rename file/directory. rename "abi.txt" to "yingyue.txt". now move your new file to "my_files" directory</li>
			<li>rm "directory" -r | delete directory. now cd do your "downloads" directory, and delete "my_files"</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Other Commands</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>start | start an application. start spotify</li>
			<li>open | open a file. download any pdf. now open it. </li>
			<li>vim/subl/code | open text editor (we will get to this later)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4 id="terminalQuiz">Terminal Quiz</h4>
		<p><strong>Boom</strong>. That is it. you have mastered the terminal. Now all you need to do is practice!</p>
		<p>navigate to your desktop. create a new directory "gabon_files". create a new dictory in this "gabon_files" named "terminal_practice". in "terminal_practice"- create one text file "terminal_quiz". now rename the text file to "passed_quiz". now move the file from "terminal_practice" to "gabon_files". now delete "terminal_practice". now using your browser, open up the text file. Now find 2 things that you could have done faster (IE less key strokes. For example, how could you have made a parent directory and a subdirectory at once?)</p>
		<p>That is all you need to know for the terminal. Now you need to practice. Get used to navigating around your laptop using the commands we learned!</li>

		
	<h4 id="environment">Environment</h4>
	<p>your "environment" is just what you use to code. you are already familiar with one part of your environment- the terminal. but you need a few more things for a full environment</p>
	<p>besides your terminal- the text editor is the most important part of your environment. we will add more to your "environment" later</p>
	<p>text editors range from minimal to robust. the truth is- nobody cares what text editor you use. all that matters is you can edit text and can program at a decent speed. Below are the 3 editors I have used extensively</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a> is the most hardcore editor. it was created in the 1970s, and acts like it. it comes pre-installed on your mac. if you become great at vim- you can be extremely fast. but, it takes forever to master vim. vim is speed. vim is pain. vim is life (or so they say).</li>
		<li><a href="https://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> is a light-weight editor. More extensive than Vim- this is my favorite. Not too much clutter. Smooth</li>
		<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> is the most popular for full time developers who do not like pain (looking at you, Vim). This was created by Microsoft. It is robust. There are many plugins to make it even more robust- too</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Again- nobody cares what text editor you use. They all get the job done. There are certainly pros and cons to each- but you should pick one and stick to it. Besides Vim- most text editors can be learned in an afternoon. Pick one. Learn the shortcuts. Stick to it. if you want my recommendation- use sublime text</p>	
	<p>Another terminal command! If you want to open a file with your code editor- then you can use vim/subl/code "file_name" to do so! If the file does not exist, then the file will be made and you can start editing right away! Try it now. Create a new text file with your text editor. save it. open it with your browswer.</p>
