Creating Wealth
    Disclaimer: I am not a professional. The only way to stick with what I have found useful is to do the work yourself and internalize this. 
   Summary:
    	Freedom
	Wealth
	Compound
	Leverage
	Own
	DIY
   Freedom
        “There’s only one success: to be able to live your life your way.” – Christopher Morley
	Be independent of money
	The goal is not to consume- but to stop worrying about money
   Create savings 
   	Maximize income by being useful to others- especially your heros (sive.rs/gethired)
        Understand the tradeoffs of consuming more 
        Track your numbers, but do not obsess
    Compounding
       Understand simple vs compounding interest 
       To compound: first maximize time, then contribution, and finally rate of return
       Avoid: hitting '0', unecessary interruptions, things that do not compound
    Leverage
       Create situations where output > input
       You can leverage money, time, knowlede, and more
       Always look for ways to apply leverage 
    Ownership
    	Name of the game: OWN LARGE EQUITY STAKES IN VALUABLE ASSETS
	Find things that compound and have leverage (for example: businesses)
    		reinvest earnings to grow (compound)
		+$1 earnings leads to +$5-$10 in value (leverage)
		businesses operate while you sleep (leverage)
	indexing: diverisifed, automatic, inexpensive, average return, tax efficient
    Do It Yourself
    	Internalize what works
	Build conviction with common sense, excel, and a plan
	Be rational, take your time, keep learning
Leverage compounding assets to become free
or
savings > valuable assets > wealth > freedom
