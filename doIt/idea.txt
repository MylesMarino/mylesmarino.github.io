	Problem- fear of failure
	Solving it is hard- fear drives us and it is common for us to only want success. we do not want to be known for failures
	Our solution- we flip the problem. get known for not trying instead of getting known for failing using social proof
	Who it has worked for- need this
	Why it works- social proof

	Failing sucks.
	What is worse than failing? Being known as a failure.
	This is why a lot of us do not complete projects. We are afraid of looking foolish. Looking dumb. Looking like failures. And we know that if we fail a lot- many might see us as failures! But this is the wrong way to think about it.
	What is worse than failing? All your friends knowing that you did not start.
	That is where we come in. We help you set a public goal- and if you do not reach this goal, two things are on the line. First, we tell all your friends. Then, we get you to donate to a charity. 
	This works because the consequences of not completing a projet are minimal. Nobody but you knows. You only lose a bit of time, and that is it. Now, because of us, you will lose time, friends' respect, and money- ONLY IF YOU DO NOT COMPLETE YOUR PROJECT. 
	Want to increase your friend's respect? Want to keep your money? Use your time wisely? Then Get. It. Done.
