<body>		<p><strong>Investing</strong> in companies that will compound generously. Mostly special situations, small companies, and value-added research.</p>
	<p><strong>Listening</strong> to people smarter than me. Subject matter experts. Business inspirations. I try to meet new and interesting people. Sometimes I <a href="./host.html">host.</a></p>
	<p><strong>Reading & writing.</strong> Took a break from writing in public. Then took a break from writing. Starting back up again. Same with <a href="./read.html">reading</a></p>
	<p><strong>Simplifying</strong> I hate complex things. I am going back to simplicity. Getting rid of the unecessary. Notes. Website. Writing. All of it. Simple.</p>
	<p><strong>Studying</strong> finance at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary">William & Mary</a>. Dabbling in government, philosophy, and entreprenuership.</p>
